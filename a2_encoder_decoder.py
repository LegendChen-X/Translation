        htilde_t : torch.FloatTensor or tuple
            Like `htilde_tm1` (either a float tensor or a pair of float
            tensors), but matching the current hidden state.
        h : torch.FloatTensor
            A float tensor of shape ``(S, M, self.hidden_state_size)`` of
            hidden states of the encoder. ``h[s, m, i]`` is the
            ``i``-th index of the encoder RNN's last hidden state at time ``s``
            of the ``m``-th sequence in the batch. The states of the
            encoder have been right-padded such that ``h[F_lens[m]:, m]``
            should all be ignored.
        F_lens : torch.LongTensor
            An integer tensor of shape ``(M,)`` corresponding to the lengths
            of the encoded source sentences.
